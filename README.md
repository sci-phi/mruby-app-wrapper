# mruby-app-wrapper

#### Work-in-Progress

## Developer Tool for Wrapping mruby logic in a binary executable


### Docker Development

This tool is primarily intended to be used via Docker images.

### Linux Development

This tool is primarily intended to be used via Docker images, so no special installation is required for Linux environments.

### Mac OS X Development

In order to allow more native development, some provision has been made for setting up a working environment on Mac OS X. Please run the script (Ruby 2.3+ required) to setup mruby :

``$ ./setup_mruby_on_mac_os.rb``
